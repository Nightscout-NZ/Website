								<p>Diabetes technologies have rapidly developed in recent years, yet New Zealandâ€™s health care system has been slow to fund diabetes technologies and NZ vendors sell many of these technologies to patients at prices far in excess of vendors in comparable countries such as Australia.<br/>Thus, relatively few New Zealanders with T1D are currently able to benefit from technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas systems. Nightscout New Zealand advocates for life-changing technologies being made available to New Zealanders living with type one diabetes as quickly as possible.</p>
								<p>In particular, Nightscout New Zealand recognizes the benefits that are offered by the innovations made by the #WeAreNotWaiting movement, which have made open-source software innovations freely available people living with type one diabetes.<br/>This includes the Nightscout project, a cloud-based system for viewing CGM data remotely in real time, CGM apps such as Xdrip+ and Spike, third party NFC-Bluetooth converters that turn a Freestyle Libre into a CGM, and the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS), OpenAPS, Loop, and AndroidAPS.</p>

								<p>Nightscout New Zealand launches in Christchurch on 23 January 2019. We plan to educate clinicians in DHBs around the country about DIY diabetes technologies and offer education and support to people with diabetes who want to implement these solutions.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Nightscout New Zealand is an advocacy and education group whose aim is to promote the use of emerging technologies for managing type one diabetes.<br/>As a group formed by those who have benefited from open-source technologies developed by #WeAreNotWaiting patient innovation movement, we believe it is important to advocate for improved funding and access to diabetes technologies and educate clinicians and people with type one diabetes about the value of DIY innovations.</p>
								<p>Nightscout New Zealand has been formed under the umbrella of the Nightscout Foundation (USA). However, as a NZ-based non-profit organization, we retain all funds for use within New Zealand.</p>
